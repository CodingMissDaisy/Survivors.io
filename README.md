# Survivors.io
Survivors.io is a crowdsourced map of anonymous sexual assault reports meant to help glean true numerical representations and more concrete understandings of who is victimized by sexual assault. This site will help in the gathering of data on gender, age, location, relationship to attacker(s), time range, reporting to law enforcement, and school campuses. Comments from the user are welcome to give further detail, but are never required. The minimum information necessary for a report is the location, which can be as general as the city where it happened. We want this to be a place everyone feels safe telling the truth about what happened without fear of victim-blaming.

This site was built by CodingMissDaisy. Deployed at Survivors.io and supported by AnnieCannons.
